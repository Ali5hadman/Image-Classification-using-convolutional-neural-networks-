The project involves using deep learning techniques to classify images into
different classes. Data augmentation and transfer learning are used to improve
the model's performance on a small and unbalanced dataset. Multiple
approaches, including handmade convolutional networks and popular
architectures, are tried, and an ensemble model is found to give the best results.
Models are trained to classify different speicie types of plants.
